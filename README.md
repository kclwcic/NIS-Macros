# NIS-Macros
Some macros useful for image processing and analysis tasks in NIS-Elements

Here are some macros we've made that you can use for yourself.
Most of these will be for automating tasks that can be iterated over many files. Saving you time!

In NIS-Elements there is a built in 'run macros on files' option which can iterate over your files for you and handle saving if desired.
Most of these macros are designed to have NIS handle the file saving for you.

Please feel free to share these - I won't upload any microscope controlling macros as that would be irresponsible if you broke an expensive bit of kit!
